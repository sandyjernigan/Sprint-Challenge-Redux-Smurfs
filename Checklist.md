## Self-Study/Essay Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this Sprint's concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager.

- [ ] In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
- [ ] What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
- [ ] Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

## Project Set Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

- [x] `fork & clone` this repository.
- [x] `cd` into the forked copy of this repository.
- [x] **RUN** `npm install`
- [x] **RUN** `npm start` --> `http://localhost:3333`.
- [x] opened chrome run `http://localhost:3333/smurfs`. Array with only Brainey shows up
- [x] **LOOK** at your `smurfs` directory and notice it's just a plain ol' React App that we've built using `create-react-app`.
- [x] **Open** `src/index.js` to make sure that your app is ready to roll with the proper middleware.
- [x] **cd** into `smurfs` and run `yarn` to retrieve the client side dependencies.
- [x] **RUN** `yarn start` to fire up your React application. There ought to be a pretty little message awaiting you welcoming you to the app. `Follow` the prompting.

- [x] **LOOK** at all the files you've been given for this project. One important file to note is `server.js`.

## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

- [x] Start in the `index.js` file by following all the prompts there to ensure that `Redux-Thunk` is wired up properly.
- [x] Because `Redux-Thunk` is wired up as a middleware for this project. Be sure to utilize thunks when appropriate:

**API Design** - This is how you'll interface with the API and what is required from every endpoint.

### GET '/smurfs'

- [a] Retrieve an array all the Smurfs in the Smurf DB by writing a `GET` to the endpoint `/smurfs`.
- [a] Double check that your response from the server is an array of smurfs.

### POST '/smurfs'

- [x] Design the functionality to add a smurf to the Smurf DB you'll need all three fields. `name`, `age`, and `height`.

- [ ] Double check to make sure that a smurf is created correctly once your functionality is built out.

Initially Brainey will be in the array, but it takes more than one smurf to make the village. Be sure to add a few smurfs to populate our smurf village.

**HINT** if you are going to be working on Stretch Problem, you'll need to use that unique `id`.

Example of object created in Smurf DB:

```js
[
  {
    name: 'Brainey',
    age: 200,
    height: '5cm',
    id: 0
  },
  {
    name: 'Sleepy',
    age: 200,
    height: '5cm',
    id: 1
  }
];
```

## STRETCH PROBLEM

The following two endpoints are here for you if you'd like to push yourselves a little further.

### PUT '/smurfs/123', where 123 is the Id of the smurf you want to modify

- [ ] For this endpoint to work, you'll need an `id` added to the URL, and at least one field to update on the Smurf object. `name` `age` `height`.

Example:

```js
input:
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Grumpy'
}
output:
[
  {
    name: 'Grumpy',
    age: 30,
    height: '3cm',
    id: 1
  },
  {
    name: 'Sleepy',
    age: 211,
    height: '2cm',
    id: 0
  }
]
```

### DELETE '/smurfs/123', where 123 is the Id of the smurf you want to remove

For this endpoint to work, all you need is an id sent up as part of the request url.

If your delete worked, you'll get a an array back with all of the smurfs but with your requested smurf removed.

- [ ] You don't need any input beyond the url parameter of the smurf, so if we send up a delete request to `/smurfs/123` then you'll remove the smurf by that id.

Example:

```js
output: [
  {
    name: 'Sleepy',
    age: 200,
    height: '5cm',
    id: 1
  }
];
```
